Frontend Nanodegree Feedreader Project
======================================

# Description

This project is requested from Udacity to complete frontend nanodegree program, which contains feedreader apllction that tested using Jasmine framework, and this is my submition.


# Project Overview

In this project you are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite. That's where you come in.


# For Developer

you can clone or download the repo and check the test cases you will find it in **./jasmine/spec/feedreader.js** and if you need to see the documentaion of jasmine check [this]((http://jasmine.github.io)) link, also there are  (**./index.html**), (**./css/style.css**) and (**./js/app.js**) these files are provided from udacity starter project you can find it [here](https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader).

after downloading or cloning the repo open index.html in the browser to see the application running and scroll down to check jasmine testing status
